# SwitchBot API Project

This project contains scripts to interact with the SwitchBot API. The main scripts are `get-token.py` and `get_device_list.py`. Additionally, the project uses a `.env` file to store sensitive information and the `__pycache__` directory is used by Python to store compiled bytecode.

## Files and Directories

### `get-token.py`

The `get-token.py` script is responsible for generating the API header required to authenticate requests to the SwitchBot API. It uses the API key and secret key stored in the `.env` file to create a signed header.

#### Key Functions:
- **generate_api_header()**: Generates the API header using the API key and secret key.

### `get_device_list.py`

The `get_device_list.py` script retrieves the list of devices associated with your SwitchBot account. It dynamically imports the `get-token.py` module to generate the API header and then makes a request to the SwitchBot API to fetch the device list.

#### Key Functions:
- **get_device_list(apiHeader)**: Makes a request to the SwitchBot API to retrieve the list of devices.

### `.env`

The `.env` file is used to store sensitive information such as the SwitchBot API key and secret key. This file should not be committed to version control and is included in the `.gitignore` file to ensure it remains private.

#### Example `.env` file:


### `__pycache__`

The `__pycache__` directory is used by Python to store compiled bytecode files. These files are automatically generated by Python to improve performance and should not be manually edited. The `__pycache__` directory is included in the `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to version control.

## Usage

1. **Set up the `.env` file**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory.
   - Add your SwitchBot API key and secret key to the `.env` file.

2. **Run the `get_device_list.py` script**:
   - Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (e.g., `requests` and `python-dotenv`).
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```sh
     python get_device_list.py
     ```

This will generate the API header, make a request to the SwitchBot API, and print the list of devices associated with your account.

## Dependencies

- [requests](http://_vscodecontentref_/3): A simple HTTP library for Python.
- `python-dotenv`: A library to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
